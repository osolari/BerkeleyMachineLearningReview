"FullName": "Katherine Daniels"
"Bio": "Katherine Daniels is a senior operations engineer at Etsy who got her start in programming with TI-80 calculators back when Geocities was still cool, and these days has opinions on things like ‘the cloud’ and ‘devops’. Before escaping to the world of operations, she spent a few years doing R&D and systems engineering in the corporate world. She lives in Brooklyn with a perfectly reasonable number of cats, and in her spare time can often be found rock-climbing or hand crafting knitted server koozies for the data center. She is co-author of O’Reilly Media’s [Effective DevOps](http://oreil.ly/1BXuIdX)."
